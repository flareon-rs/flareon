//! Forms and form fields for handling user input.
//!
//! This module provides a way to define forms and form fields for handling user
//! input in a web application. It provides a way to create forms from requests,
//! validate the form data, and render the form fields in an HTML form.
//!
//! # `Form` derive macro
//!
//! The easiest way to work with forms in Cot is to use the
//! [`Form`](derive@Form) derive macro. Just define a structure that will hold
//! all the form data you need, and derive the [`Form`] trait for it.
//!
//! ```
//! use cot::form::Form;
//!
//! #[derive(Form)]
//! struct MyForm {
//!     #[form(opt(max_length = 100))]
//!     name: String,
//! }
//! ```

///
/// This macro will generate an implementation of the [`Form`] trait for the
/// given named struct. Note that all the fields of the struct **must**
/// implement the [`AsFormField`] trait.
///
/// # Rendering
///
/// In order for the [`FormContext`] to be renderable in templates, all the form
/// fields (i.e. [`AsFormField::Type`]) must implement the [`Display`] and
/// [`rinja::filters::HtmlSafe`] traits. If you are implementing your own form
/// field types, you should make sure they implement these traits (and you have
/// to make sure the types are safe to render as HTML, possibly escaping user
/// input if needed).
///
/// Note that even if the form is not rendered in a template, you will still be
/// able to render the fields individually.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The implementation of [`Display`] for the form context that this derive
/// macro generates depends on the implementation of [`Display`] for the form
/// fields. If the form fields are not safe to render as HTML, the form context
/// will not be safe to render as HTML either.
